We’re starting a new research lab, 
which we’re calling YC Research, 
to work on some of these areas.

We’re going to start YCR with one group 
(which we should be ready to announce in a month or two) 
and if that goes well, we’ll add others. 

YCR is a non-profit.
Any IP developed will be made available freely to everyone.
(The researchers will, of course, have full discretion over when they’re 
ready to release their work, and we’ll have a process in place to
 address technology that could be dangerous.)  

Because of the openness, the researchers will be able to freely 
collaborate with people in other institutions. 

We’re not doing this with the goal of helping YC’s startups 
succeed or adding to our bottom line.  At the risk of sounding cliché, 
this is for the benefit of the world.  As we’ve seen throughout history, 
new technological breakthroughs help all of us.  

Fundamental research is critical to driving the world forward, 
and funding for it keeps getting cut.

Mathematical Methods for Quantitative Finance (by Dr. Kjell Konis)

This are course materials, so that's math mixed with some financial concepts like bond duration or perpetual annuities:
