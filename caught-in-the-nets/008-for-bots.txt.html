  Dollar Moves Shake the World: 
“Federal Reserve Could Start a Currency War”

How did the Federal Reserve get so much power
over the American economy – and that of the
world’s? There have been many stages of the
theft which are too numerous to list, but which
are generally well known to those familiar with
its odious origins as a design by the banking
cartel.

Started under conspiratorial circumstances
back in 1913, the Federal Reserve has
established itself as a private central bank
for the country, though it is not part of the
U.S. government. Since its inception, the Fed
has driven the dollar down to just a fraction
of its original value.

Americans face a further decline in
their standard of living in all cases,
market-wide conditions that the Fed alone can
determine. Their wealth is rapidly evaporating.

If the Fed raises rates, the market will
crash. On the otherhand, if it doesn’t raise
rates, and continues indefinitely on its course
of quantative easing, investors, middle class
and working families, businesses, as well as
pensions, benefit programs and insurance policies
will also die a slow painful economic death.

FALSE (as one of conspiracy one)

  Goodbye, t-test: new stats models for A/B testing 
boost accuracy/effectivness

The t-test has served as a workhorse for
conversion optimization teams for many years
— though there’s always been confusion about
what the results really mean.

Fortunately, there are now solutions. Optimizely
and VWO have both developed new models for
analyzing A/B testing and conversion results
that can help businesses keep up with the flood
of data they get from their websites.

Optimizely’s Stats Engine uses sequential
testing. It’s better suited for A/B testing,
because it evaluates results as data comes in,
instead of  “fixed horizon testing” using a
fixed sample size. Doing so brings a Bayesian
view that creates a likelihood ratio, a model
for how the variation is expected to perform

  Exist And Interact With Our World, Say Physicists

“The idea of parallel universes in quantum
mechanics has been around since 1957,”
explained Howard Wiseman, a physicist at Griffith
University in Brisbane, Australia, and one of
the physicists to come up with MIW. “In the
well-known ‘Many-Worlds Interpretation’, each
universe branches into a bunch of new universes
every time a quantum measurement is made. All
possibilities are therefore realised – in some
universes the dinosaur-killing asteroid missed
Earth. In others, Australia was colonised by
the Portuguese.”

“But critics question the reality of these
other universes, since they do not influence our
universe at all,” he added. “On this score,
our “Many Interacting Worlds” approach is
completely different, as its name implies.”

Wiseman and colleagues have proposed that there
exists “a universal force of repulsion between
‘nearby’ (i.e. similar) worlds, which tends
to make them more dissimilar.” Quantum effects
can be explained by factoring in this force,
they propose.

Whether or not the math holds true will be
the ultimate test for this theory. Does it or
does it not properly predict quantum effects
mathematically? But the theory is certain to
provide plenty of fodder for the imagination.

For instance, when asked about whether their
theory might entail the possibility that humans
could someday interact with other worlds, Wiseman
said: “It’s not part of our theory. But the
idea of [human] interactions with other universes
is no longer pure fantasy.”

What might your life look like if you made
different choices? Maybe one day you’ll be
able to look into one of these alternative worlds
and find out.

  Learning With a Advanced Teacher

In this lecture, Vladimir Vapnik will discuss
how the LUPI learning model can take the form
of comments, descriptions, metaphoric reasoning
and other teaching tactics. He will describe the
goal of the model — to develop good decision
rules even when only a small number of examples
is provided.

  Is Signaled By iM's Business Cycle Index

Knowing when the U.S. economy is heading for
recession is paramount for successful investment
decisions. Our weekly Business Cycle Index (BCI)
would have provided early reliable warnings for
the past seven recessions.

The BCI at 199.0 up from last week's revised
198.2; it is at a new high for the current
business cycle, which is also indicated by BCIp
on 100. The 6-month smoothed annualized growth
BCIg at 13.9 is also higher compared to last
week's 13.2. No recession is signaled.

Figure 1 plots BCIp, BCI, BCIg and the S&P
500 together with the thresholds (red lines)
that need to be crossed to be able to call
a recession.

  Got it wrong. Bank Customers would do banking with AI in the Future

“Hey Siri – Are you the bank of the
future?”… “No comment, David” –
Sometimes when someone says no comment that means
no but when the thing saying it is a computer
assistant then “no comment” means someone
has taken the time to think about it and decide
upon a snarky comment rather than nothing at all!

For years AI has been a good idea without real
world application or the processing power,
connectivity or interface intelligence to
maximize the opportunity. In the last 6 months,
and ever increasingly, those restrictions are
being removed and companies like IBM, Apple and
Google are breaking down the challenges that
lead us to being able to utilize both Artificial
Intelligence and voice interfaces.

For banks this could unlock huge amounts of
potential, dramatically reduce operating costs,
significantly decreasing risk and fraud as well
as have the potential to finally live up to
their data potential.

...  The Career Trajectory

This is one of the most unique parts of Lever’s
hiring. The Career Trajectory interview is a
deep-dive into your professional history with a
single interviewer – covering everything from
education, to your first job, to present day
in a structured, chronological format. We’re
still building the foundational team at Lever,
and it’s important for us to understand you by
exploring topics like decision-making styles,
what energizes or drains you, and what kind
of managers you work best with. Every current
Leveroo has been through this interview and it
speaks to the strong intention that we approach
every hire with.

My CT interview felt in some ways like a
therapy session. As a software engineer with
an untraditional background, I appreciated the
forum to express my goals for my career and
to have a deep, authentic conversation about
why I believed Lever was the right place for
me. The CT interview demonstrated to me Lever’s
recognition that candidates are so much more than
just a list of programming languages, projects,
or skills. It was a refreshing change of pace
from other companies’ interview processes
where it felt like they only cared about the
code I could produce. Here at Lever, we’re
looking for team members who show ownership
and passion for their work and personal growth,
and these interviews keep that goal in mind.

We’ve designed our hiring process thoughtfully
and with great care so that we can find the
best people to help us continue transforming
the hiring landscape. If you’re interested in
helping out and being part of a company that
values its employees as whole, human beings,
join us!

  One of Silicon Valley's boom in tech

Revered Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael
Moritz has published a brutal takedown of the
recent boom in "unicorn" tech businesses worth
over $1 billion, saying many are "subprime."
In an opinion piece in the Financial Times
published late on Friday, Moritz, a partner
at Sequoia Capital, says that many startups
recently valued at $1 billion (£650 million)
or above "seem the flimsiest of edifices."

When Moritz talks, people sit up and listen. The
"Welsh wizard" is one of the most famous
and successful VCs in America. He was an
early investor in Google, YouTube, Yahoo!,
and PayPal. He currently sits on the board of
companies including Stripe and LinkedIn. He's
proved his chops.

It’s crazy to think that my 13-week Eurotrip
throughout the Summer of 2015 has already passed.

I’m sitting here freezing my butt off in a
coffee shop in downtown Kiev, Ukraine – my
final destination in Europe before I head to
Asia until 2016.

How on earth it suddenly turn winter? It’s
32F/0C degrees outside and this hot tea is not
warming me up (let alone my lack of a winter
coat).

It feels like just yesterday when I was sitting
in my room in Arizona, counting downing the days
until my trip started. Time flies, dude.

Here is a look at the last 13 weeks of my life
across more than 25 countries.

  By 2020 there will be 1M programming jobs left unfulfilled

Facebook today announced the launch of TechPrep,
a new online computer science and programming
resource, to address what it sees as a “lack
of exposure to computer science and careers
in technology,” especially prevalent in
“underrepresented groups including Black and
Hispanic communities.”

TechPrep will be available in English and
Spanish, and pulls together hundreds of
resources including games, books, in-person
opportunities, and community events (see all the
resources here). To help children and guardians
better understand the tech industry and career
opportunities, Facebook breaks down types of
programming, programming benefits, and the future
of programming jobs.

“By 2020 there will be 1 million programming
jobs left unfulfilled,” Facebook says on the
TechPrep website. “What are you waiting for?”
