  Global “Powerhouses” Germany and UK Slow “Dramatically”

Shocks may originate in advanced or emerging
markets and, combined with unaddressed system
vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset
market disruption and a sudden drying up of
market liquidity in many asset classes.

– IMF warn of “fresh financial crisis” –
German exports fall 5.2%, largest slump since
recession of 2009 – German imports also fall
3.1% – Many sectors across German economy
see unexpected declines in factory orders and
industrial production – UK Chief Financial
Officers (CFOs) report sharp rise in uncertainty
– UK PMI has fallen to lowest level since April
2013 – Hope for the best but be prepared for
less benign scenarios

  Why Do High-Frequency Traders Cancel So Many Orders?

I think to understand most HFT market makers
you have to understand how the markets pay.

Most work on a maker taker model. Which means
the trader who initiates the trade pays a small
fee and the trader who is the passive side, the
one who had their order in the market already,
gets paid a small fee. as a side note there
are inverted markets but lets leave those aside
for now.

This means to get paid you want to be at the top
of the book, which means you are the first order
to get filled when someone crosses the spread
to get their order filled. the way priority
is determined is first by price and second by
time. So you have a very vested interest in
being the first to cancel and move your order
to the newest price level.

Exchanges have tried introducing some order types
to alleviate this constant send/cancel routine
such as the order type "Hide not Slide" but
people tend to get upset at these order types.

Once you understand this, you start to realize
that almost all HFT firms aren't quote stuffing,
they are just jockeying for position at the top
of the order book.

I've never really understood quote stuffing,
the same firm that quote stuffs still has to deal
with those quotes coming back, its not like the
market data has a flag saying ignore this quote
change as its caused by your own quote stuffing.

The way most markets are setup is that quotes
come from gateways and multiple symbols
all share a single gateway, usually assigned
alphabetically, so A-F tickers all share the same
gateway. This means that if someone is actually
slowing down market data for say AAPL then they
are also slowing down quotes for AMZN as well
but again, the same firm that is quote stuffing
also has to deal with their own mess so I can't
see the benefit.

Another comment complains that HFT firms don't
like the fragmented market. That is true to a
point, but keep in mind most HFT strategies
only work due to the fragmented markets and
RegNMS. So while they may not like 11 venues,
they certainly want atleast 3 or 4, and many
of hte top HFT firms run their own dark pools,
adding to the problem:)

As far as Hillary Clinton introducing legislation
to curb HFT trading, she was the senator for
New York. I'm dubious of her coming down hard
on Wall Street.

  A Raspberry Pi daughterboard hat that features 
a Lattice FPGA, 32 MB of RAM, EEPROM, and a few
Grove and PMOD connectors

The CAT takes advantage of the open source
tool chain available for Lattice including
the Python-based MyHDL (although, you could
just use Verilog directly, if you prefer) and
Icestorm. One interesting point: you can run
the tool chain on the Raspberry Pi, resulting
in a self-contained and largely portable FPGA
development environment.


The design files are actually on Github. You
may notice the SATA connectors. However, [Dave]
doesn’t know if you could really use SATA
drives with them–they are there for general
purpose differential I/O.

It is great to have an open source board and tool
chain for FPGA development. We’ve talked about
the open source Icestorm toolchain before and
MyHDL, too.  If you prefer, most of the vendor
FPGA tools are free to use for many common
devices and uses. The Lattice tools should work
just as well with this board, even if it does
offend your open source sensibilities.

The video below introduces the CAT board, but be
warned: it does contain actual cat pictures. It
does not, however, contain any apologies to
Dr. Seuss

  with BT and WiFi :-)

Aptiva’s Zynq-based Parallella and
MYIR’s Z-Turn Board each starts at $99, the
Snickerdoodle starts at $55, or $60 with free
shipping in the U.S. Not surprisingly, with 45
days still to go, Krtkl has already won over a
fifth of its 50K goal for the Snickerdoodle on
the Crowd Supply crowdfunding site.

With its extensive I/O enabled by the FPGA,
the 89 x 51mm Snickerdoodle is aimed primarily
at projects like drones and robots that require
motor control and a variety of sensors. Computer
vision systems can also benefit, says San
Francisco startup Krtkl. The company lists
potential applications like building an Arduino
clone, a wireless pattern generator and logic
analyzer, a cycle-accurate NES emulator, a
cat-tracking robot, or even a custom-architecture
microcontroller.

The base configuration uses a Zynq-7010, with
the pair of Cortex-A9 cores clocked to 667MHz
and a relatively low, 430-gate FPGA. Add $60
for a Zynq-7020 with an 866MHz clock rate,
a 1.3M-gate FPGA, and 179 GPIOs, up from the
standard 154. A heat sink is tossed in to cool
this faster processor. There’s an on-board
STM32 microcontroller that functions as a
USB-to-serial bridge, power supply manager,
Bluetooth integration bridge, boot source
controller, USB boot flash mass storage device
bridge, LED and button controller, and I2C
auto-configuration manager.  With either Zynq
option, the base configuration is 512MB of
RAM, upgradeable to 1GB ($10). The board comes
standard with a TI Wilink 8 wireless module
with 2.4GHz, 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0
(both classic and LE). A $15 upgrade boosts the
WiFi to 2.4GHz/5GHz, 2×2 MIMO operation, and a
$10 option orients the GPIO downward instead of
up, which the company recommends when using its
“MicroShield” expansion boards. Standard
features include a lockable microSD slot,
a microUSB 2.0 port with serial console and
storage support, and a wide-range 3.7 to 17V
power supply.

Options include a $25 enclosure, a $5 set of
pin housings, and a $10 pack of 50 19cm jumpers
with Samtec pins on one end to plug into the pin
housings, and 0.1-inch female pins and housing
on the other for “Frankensteining” projects
breadboard style. If that’s not enough, you can
move up to a $25 BreakyBreaky breakout baseboard,
also using 0.1-inch headers. This is one of a
variety of expansion MicroShield boards that
will be ready when the Snickerdoodle ships in
March 2016, says the company.

  Four Rs that for today's software-defined businesses.

The core of IT is now DevOps, and the name of the
game is speed to market -- turning technology
around as fast as the business needs it. There
isn't time for long deliberative processes and
roadmaps, Arbuckle argues. Roadmaps quickly
become outdated in today's digital businesses.

In a compelling post, he outlines the four Rs
that need to define today's EA:

Review: Arbuckle recommends having an
architecture review body to keep everyone on the
same page. "Much of the change we need to drive,
whether as engineers or architects, needs to be
prefaced with great gobs of education. Rather
than coming from on high, open discussions
between people working on important projects is
the most effective way of seeing the change in
thinking occurring as well as to seed it."

Renew: Always be open to new approaches and
technologies, Arbuckle recommends. "Everyone has
their favorite language. Enterprise architects
again can facilitate a useful conversation
on alternatives.... Today's successful EAs
lead projects that produce an MVP using new
technology."

Refactor. "Traditionally if we want to deploy a
large HR system implementation, we would spend
a great deal of time collecting requirements,
arguing with the vendor about how much those
customization would cost, waiting for the changes
to be delivered and then hoping it all works as
advertised on the infrastructure you ordered 18
months ago," Arbuckle says. "What is possible
and preferable is instead deploying even this
behemoth in small batches... The EA needs to
evangelize, promote, and drive this process
of changing how we practice the evolution of
technology in our business."

Resilience. "What kind of organization do we
want to create? The EA needs to define what
resilience both technically and culturally means
for the technology organization." Good examples
of resilient organization are emergency rooms and
airline flight decks, he points out. Hallmarks
of resilience include tracking small failures,
resisting oversimplification, being sensitive
to operations, and deferring to expertise

  An Artificial Intelligence Research Center In Germany

Google has been putting serious investment into
building out its artificial intelligence, deep
learning and robotics capabilities, and this
week the company made its latest move to tap
into some of the more cutting edge work going
on in the field, specifically in Europe.

The search giant, through its German division
Google Germany, has made an investment in
the German Research Centre for Artificial
Intelligence (the DFKI), a nonprofit institute
where some 450 scientists, academics and
others work on projects in areas like language
technology, embedded intelligence and augmented
reality; and occasionally spin out businesses
based on those projects. It’s one of the
largest research centers of its kind.

Google is not disclosing the amount of its
investment but confirms that the stake will give
Google a seat on the DFKI’s board.

  secret to successful remote software engineering

Finding good engineers is hard, no doubt. However
using good engineers remotely requires the remote
team or remote lead person on that team to have
additional skills in order to make it work.

Be Proactive & Driven – This is the single
most important quality for any remote engineer /
remote team manager. The reason is that when
someone is sitting in the office, you can
instantly see if someone is not engaged, or
stuck. You can just tap him on the shoulder and
ask what’s up buddy? Is there anything I can do
to help? What are you working on? etc. In remote
teams that is not possible, so you need to ensure
the person on the other side, and possibly in
the other time-zone, is proactive. He will get
on call at strange local times, he will email
you that something isn’t working. He will flag
that he finished his tasks and needs more work,
or even let you know that while you’ve planned
it before, seems he is finishing early. He
will be the type of person tapping himself
on the shoulder and not requiring anyone to
chase him. EVER! This type of person will make
or break your remote / outsource / not in the
office work environment.

Resourceful – Resourcefulness goes hand in
hand with being pro-active. When working in
a remote team, many times you will be faced
with integration issues. Integration issues
are the ones that take up a lot of time. The
back-end RESTAPI that is suppose to return X
returns Y. Break. Your mobile app / front-end app
cannot read / write the data and the work cannot
continue, or perhaps it can? While the proactive
perosn would raise the issue, a resourceful
one would also find a creative way to continue
his work. For example, many times I will create
mock data / a mock server when I can’t get the
back-end to work. This can mean the difference
between 24-48 hours delay in the work, to zero
down time, or just 1-2 hours to fix a bug. A
resourceful person will find an alternate path to
continue his work, create solution to a problem
or just move to another task. Resourcefulness is
highly important for any engineer, but in remote
teams it is vital as it can be the difference
between making the remote team work, and reaching
the conclusion that remote teams do not work.

Understand Product – Finding a good engineer
that can also understand product is very
difficult. However when working remotely this
not only becomes a nice to have, it becomes
vital. Understanding product means thinking
in terms of user experience, and what is
the easiest and most intuitive way to use the
application. Many talented engineers can produce
great code per requirements or spec, but do not
think in terms of what the user needs. When
this happens in house, the product lead can
very quickly do a course adjustment: “Hey, I
thought that would work, but on second thought
let’s scratch that and move this button over
here.” With remote teams these iterations
might take more time, and so it’s important
to have someone you trust that would adjust the
course himself. Someone who would understand
what the “real requirements are” or what the
functional requirements are, and build the right
usability for the user. Even if not perfect,
then the product person would have a much smaller
adjustment to make. Understanding product is
not simple, but once you find the right person
that can do that, you’re setting yourself up
for success with remote teams / engineers.

Result Oriented – Most people hate
micromanagement, and while sometimes management
does need to intervene in the remote environment,
this becomes almost impossible. That is why in
remote environments, your engineer / lead must be
result oriented. He is not focused on completing
a feature, or getting his “workload” ticked
off. He should be focused on making sure your
business goals are achieved, and that his part
is playing it’s role in the global scheme of
things. A result oriented person would ask about
your business deadlines, when do things need
to be done by, and why. This means that person
is not about just counting the hours worked,
but about making sure he is helping you get to
where you need to be.

  When hackers talk, this research team listens

If you're a hacker, you gather as much data as
you can on your targets, in search of something
valuable.

If you're researcher Hsinchun Chen, you gather
as much data as you can on the hackers.

Chen, a professor of management information
systems at the University of Arizona, works in
a little-explored, but hugely important area
of cybersecurity: Exploring the motivations of
hackers and other cyberattackers, and trying
to predict how they might act, based on their
behaviors.

With support from the National Science
Foundation's (NSF) Social, Behavioral
and Economic Sciences directorate and the
Directorate for Computer and Information
Science and Engineering under the Secure and
Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, Chen and
his collaborators have generated findings that
shed light on how hacker communities interact and
share information—and even created actionable
intelligence for criminal investigations by
federal agencies.
