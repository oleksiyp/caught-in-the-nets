The fourth generation of machine learning: Adaptive learning

4th generation: Adaptive learning
Adaptive learning brings human analysts into the process at every step. This is in contrast to rule-based, simple machine learning and deep learning approaches, where the humans only create rules and label data at the start of the process. For example, if you had the sentence “We Will Help Tom Ford Escape from New York”, and your system hadn’t seen any examples of “Tom Ford” or “Ford Escape”, you will need human input to build the knowledge.

Adaptive learning systems require the least human effort because they only require human input when it matters most and continually expand their knowledge when new information is encountered. As we show here, they are also the most accurate. They combine the three other types of machine intelligence, adding new types of ‘unsupervised machine learning’ and methods for optimizing the input from multiple, possibly disagreeing, humans.
