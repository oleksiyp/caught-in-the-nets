  Machine Learning Applied To Real World Quant Strategies

I'm sure you've noticed the oversaturation of beginner Python tutorials
and stats/machine learning references available on the internet.

Few tutorials actually tell you how to apply them to your algorithmic
trading strategies in an end-to-end fashion.

There are hundreds of textbooks, research papers, blogs and forum
posts on time series analysis, econometrics, machine learning and
Bayesian statistics.

Nearly all of them concentrate on the theory.

What about practical implementation? How do you use that method for
your strategy? How do you actually program up that formula in software?

I've written Advanced Algorithmic Trading to solve these problems.

  We don’t save for the future because we lie to ourselves. This app might change that

I personally belive this author because of the book Predictably
Irrational.

And that's his final findings.

As humans, our failings are epic. We eat too much, lie to ourselves,
never exercise enough, and spend so much money we have nothing left
for that vacation in Hawaii. But technology, Dan Ariely believes,
might save us from ourselves.

Ariely says the app will force people to think about the opportunity
cost of money, or what you give up (saving for college) to get what
you want (another bottle of rare gin). You can create a goal—a
$300 budget for groceries—and an anti-goal—whatever is not spent
from that $300 goes toward something else (Ariely is saving for a
car). You can pre-assign money to do the things you mean to do but
don’t do. Every time you spend $3 on coffee, you can donate $1
to your favorite charity (and perhaps start curbing your expensive
coffee habit).

  More Evidence that Income Inequality Sucks

The world is slowly reaching the conclusion that income inequality is
toxic for human welfare. Books such as The Spirit Level, Why Nations
Fail, and Capital in the 21st Century make the case at the macro scale
by chronicling the fate of nations. In the United States of America,
income inequality has swung like a slow pendulum, reaching an extreme
during the Gilded Age and today. Well-being has swung in the reverse
direction, as shown in this remarkable graph compiled by Evolution
Institute Vice President Peter Turchin (go here for details).

IMG:001-inequality.jpg

A new study provides more evidence for the toxic effects of inequality,
if more is needed. A team of economists led by Robert H. Frank measured
changes in income inequality in each of the states and in the 100
most densely populated counties in America during the period 1990-2000

Facebook has a software quality problem. I’m going to try to convince
you with three examples. This is important because it demonstrates

  Cats!

Now it’s time for us, the third generation of quantum scientists,
to give quantum mechanics the reputation it deserves: that of a
beautiful and simple theory that should be understood by as many
people as possible. Here at the Institute for Quantum Computing,
we are making great efforts to share our research and teach quantum
theory to our community. Every year we host around 40 high school
students from Canada and the world and teach them the basics of quantum
mechanics in the Quantum Cryptography School for Young Students. IQC
has also recently started a training program called Teaching Quantum
Technology, aimed for teachers who are interested in introducing the
ideas behind quantum mechanics and their application to technology
in their classrooms. Recently, we even created a video game: Quantum
Cats! This is only an example of a worldwide trend to spread our
knowledge of quantum mechanics, a movement that is guided by the
conviction that Bohr and Feynman were wrong: anyone can understand
quantum mechanics.

  as quantum: Why we think like quarks?

The fuzziness and weird logic of the way particles behave applies
surprisingly well to how humans think

IMG:003-qminds.jpg

THE quantum world defies the rules of ordinary logic. Particles
routinely occupy two or more places at the same time and don’t
even have well-defined properties until they are measured. It’s all
strange, yet true – quantum theory is the most accurate scientific
theory ever tested and its mathematics is perfectly suited to the
weirdness of the atomic world.

Yet that mathematics actually stands on its own, quite independent of
the theory. Indeed, much of it was invented well before quantum theory
even existed, notably by German mathematician David Hilbert. Now,
it’s beginning to look as if it might apply to a lot more than just
quantum physics, and quite possibly even to the way people think.

Human thinking, as many of us know, often fails to respect the
principles of classical logic. We make systematic errors when
reasoning with probabilities, for example. Physicist Diederik Aerts
of the Free University of Brussels, Belgium, has shown that these
errors actually make sense within a wider logic based on quantum
mathematics. The same logic also seems to fit naturally with how people
link concepts together, often on the basis of loose associations and
blurred boundaries. That means search algorithms based on quantum
logic could uncover meanings in masses of text more efficiently than
classical algorithms

Soon: Artificial trees will save our atmosphere from CO2 emission

The scientists came to the conclusion that they can put the climate
global warming on hold on position with artificial trees and their job
will be to consume the CO2 out from the atmosphere. Yes of course this
is possible! The scientists developed a new technology of material that
can extract CO2 from the atmosphere and to condense into fibers. That
kind of fiber also can be used in electronics, cars, buildings,
clothing and other manufactured products. They said that artificial
trees will return our atmospheric CO2 to pre industrial decade.

  Researchers Create Better Algorithm for Simulating Particles in Fermi Sea

A North Carolina State University physicist and his German colleagues
have created a new, more precise algorithm for simulating particle
interactions when a single impurity is introduced into a Fermi sea. The
algorithm shows that when these particles interact, the transition from
quasiparticle to bound molecule in a polarized two-dimensional system
is smooth. The new method may have implications for understanding
the behavior of impurities in a variety of systems.

The Fermi sea describes a collection of weakly interacting identical
fermions such as electrons that have been cooled to a very low
temperature. No two fermions within the sea have exactly the same
quantum state. The ground state of the Fermi sea in this pure form
is well understood. However, what happens when an impurity – such
as a particle with a different spin – is introduced? How does that
one particle affect the system as a whole?

  Hidden Reasons People Spend Too Much

You can get all the basics right and yet still break your
budget. Researchers are beginning to discover why

“The lesson here is to be a little bit thoughtful about your
spending, where the money is coming from and the costs associated
with that, rather than taking a rule given to you and using it for
everything,” she says.

Stop spending to reward yourself Many people go awry in their spending
because of the way they view willpower—and what they feel they
deserve for using it.

Studies have found that some people imagine willpower as something that
is a limited resource and is fairly easily depleted, while others see
it as something abundant that doesn’t run out. That leads to very
different behavior in times of stress. People who think willpower
is limited think they deserve to reward themselves for showing some
willpower, while people who think it’s unlimited think no reward
is needed or deserved.

Mind your mood when spending

Other research has begun to explore the tangled relationship between
moods and money habits. When people are sad, their habits are
worse. When they are happy, their habits are better. Even if money
can’t buy happiness, it seems that happiness can buy money.

Don’t let your home equity tempt you

Finally, people display a blind spot when it comes to their homes. Many
people spend more when the value of their assets—particularly
their property—goes up, even though in reality those assets often
won’t add to their spending power in the future. In fact, for
each $1 increase in the market value of a home, certain households
increased their consumption by six cents to 18 cents, according to
a 2013 study in the Review of Economics and Statistics.

In general, Mr. Cooper says that people need to think about their
homes not as an investment, not even as a regular financial asset,
but as a place to live. What’s more, people shouldn’t think about
a home as a tool for borrowing more money. “If you max out your
home-equity line of credit and then housing prices change, chances
are you will find yourself financially constrained,” he says.

Everything You Know Is Wrong: The Boston Tea Party

IMG:006-tea-party.jpg

What people call history is really myth. History is a tale told
by bloody conquerors, failed novelists, and small town football
coaches earning their keep in public schools. It’s a system of
power. He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls
the present controls the past. Court historians regard the myth as
sacrosanct. They never question its veracity and are quick to deride
anyone who voices doubt.

Americans spend their school years struggling to memorize names and
dates. In the decades afterward, they take pride in the scattering
of facts they manage to retain. So, of course, they get pretty upset
when you show them most of those precious facts were lies.

But for those with an open mind, those last few willing to question
anything and anyone, discovering the truth is exhilarating. Truth
is what we’re after. We’ll chase it down whether it sets us
free as Jesus said it would, or destroys us like Oedipus. In each
installment of Everything You Know Is Wrong, I examine unquestioned
facts—historic, scientific, social, and religious—to reveal the
truth beneath the myth.

  part IV: life cylces

In the current vernacular we no longer speak about development
life-cycles but instead about Agile and its variants. And if one were
to review the documents promoting Agile and the components that make
up what appears to be it’s framework it could be found that Agile
is nothing more than a variant on existing life-cycles as defined
by software engineering practitioners. Steven McConnell of Construx
Software is aware of this since he wrote the book on standardised
software engineering practices. And though he propose the use of
Agile techniques his interpretation of these techniques are well
founded upon long standing software engineering principles.

  yet another stellarator

Germany is about to start up a monster machine that could revolutionise
the way we use energy

For more than 60 years, scientists have dreamed of a clean,
inexhaustible energy source in the form of nuclear fusion.

And they’re still dreaming.

But thanks to the efforts of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma
Physics, experts hope that might soon change.

Last year, after 1.1 million construction hours, the Institute
completed the world’s largest nuclear fusion machine of its kind,
called a stellarator.

They call it this 52-foot wide machine the W7-X.

And following more than a year of tests, engineers are finally ready
to fire up the $US1.1 billion machine for the first time, and it
could happen before the end of this month, "Science" reported.

  Just Brain Rules for Presenters

We know that it takes you about 10 minutes to lose an audience if
you’re just giving a normal talk. So at the nine-minute-and-59-second
mark, you have to do something fairly radical. In fact, you should do
it within 30 seconds of your first words, but certainly at nine minutes
and 59 seconds. And here is where we can get into some brain science.

It’s pretty simple. When a piece of information comes into the brain,
your brain immediately interrogates it with six questions right off the
bat. And you can see the Darwinian roots of the brain’s processing
features really clearly here.

The first question it will ask is, will it eat me? You’re going
to make an assessment of threat; that’s a survival mechanism. The
second question is, can I eat it? Question number three is, can I
have sex with it? And it’s actually not even sex per se. It’s,
is there reproductive opportunity?

Question number four is, can it have sex with me? Questions number
five and six to me are professionally the most interesting, because
there’s no a priori for them. It just shows you something about
how the brain learns: Have I seen it before? Or, have I never seen
it before? The reason why is, the brain is an unbelievably gifted
pattern matcher, and it’s looking for patterns that it’s seen.
