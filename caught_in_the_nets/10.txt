  Hidden Reasons People Spend Too Much

You can get all the basics
right and yet still break your
budget. Researchers are beginning to
discover why

“The lesson here is to be a little
bit thoughtful about your spending,
where the money is coming from and the
costs associated with that, rather
than taking a rule given to you and
using it for everything,” she says.

Stop spending to reward yourself Many
people go awry in their spending
because of the way they view
willpower—and what they feel they
deserve for using it.

Studies have found that some people
imagine willpower as something that
is a limited resource and is fairly
easily depleted, while others see it
as something abundant that doesn’t
run out. That leads to very different
behavior in times of stress. People
who think willpower is limited think
they deserve to reward themselves for
showing some willpower, while people
who think it’s unlimited think no
reward is needed or deserved.

Mind your mood when spending

Other research has begun to explore
the tangled relationship between moods
and money habits. When people are sad,
their habits are worse. When they are
happy, their habits are better. Even
if money can’t buy happiness, it
seems that happiness can buy money.

Don’t let your home equity tempt you

Finally, people display a blind spot
when it comes to their homes. Many
people spend more when the value of
their assets—particularly their
property—goes up, even though in
reality those assets often won’t
add to their spending power in the
future. In fact, for each $1 increase
in the market value of a home, certain
households increased their consumption
by six cents to 18 cents, according
to a 2013 study in the Review of
Economics and Statistics.

In general, Mr. Cooper says that
people need to think about their homes
not as an investment, not even as
a regular financial asset, but as a
place to live. What’s more, people
shouldn’t think about a home as a
tool for borrowing more money. “If
you max out your home-equity line of
credit and then housing prices change,
chances are you will find yourself
financially constrained,” he says.
