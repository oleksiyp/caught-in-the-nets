  compact guide discusses everything around concurrency and synchronization

Concurrency is always a challenge for developers
and writing concurrent programs can be extremely
hard. There is a number of things that could
potentially blow up and the complexity of
systems rises considerably when concurrency
is introduced. However, the ability to write
robust concurrent programs is a great tool
in a developer’s belt and can help build
sophisticated, enterprise level applications.

In this course, you will dive into the magic
of concurrency. You will be introduced to the
fundamentals of concurrency and concurrent
code and you will learn about concepts like
atomicity, synchronization and thread safety. As
you advance, the following lessons will deal
with the tools you can leverage, such as the
Fork/Join framework, the java.util.concurrent
JDK package. To sum those up, you will learn
about testing concurrent applications.

  The Biggest Myths

 * the government “prints money”.  * banks
 “lend reserves” * the US government is
 running out of money and must pay back the
 national debt. (who knows?)  * national debt is
 a burden that will ruin our children’s futures
 (no? really) * QE is inflationary “money
 printing” and/or “debt monetization”.
 * Hyperinflation is caused by “money
 printing”.  * Government spending drives up
 interest rates and bond vigilantes control
 interest rates.  * The Fed was created by a
 secret cabal of bankers to wreck the US economy.
 * Fallacy of composition.  * Interest Costs of
 the National Debt Will Lead to Uncontrollable
 Interest Burdens * Economics is a science.

  component exchange, with React UI Builder

One of the major features of React UI Builder
is the source code generation for React
components. The builder helps developer not only
to compose UI for a Web application but also it
generates the source code from combination of
other components.

React UI Builder is not intended to replace
the code writing process, it just replaces
developer’s routine work. Especially it can be
helpful if we take in account that the builder
has a pluggable mechanism for generators.

To generate new React component from a
combination of other components select the root
component of the combination and choose option
“Generate new component” from dropdown menu
of the component’s toolbar.

Modal dialog with a wizard will appear, where we
have to enter a group of a new component and its
name, then we have to choose one of the existing
generators in current project.

In the last step of the wizard we will see
the prepared source code of the component
and optionally the source code of other files
(modules) if the generator was set up to create
them.

Saving generated source code will cause
recompilation of the project and we will see new
component in the left side panel of available
components.

  suffering is the Commodity That you Provide

You might be under the impression that what
makes you qualified for various positions
in software development is primarily your
technical acumen and ability to work with other
technically-capable engineers.

You’d be wrong.

While a certain minimum of capability is required
to do your day-to-day work, what your value
really consists of is in grinding yourself
against the piercing pincers of elusive bugs
and razor-wire bundles of bullshit code until
something resembling progress is made.

You are not a problem-solver, you are a
problem-endurer.

Someone is Always Ready to Undercut You

And the guy who is going to replace our
newly-spined software architect? He’s the guy
sitting across from you who never complains
about the code, never ‘wastes his time’
cleaning things up, and is always the first to
shut down ‘toxic’ discussion. He’s the
one whose ego has him up to his eye-balls in
debt on consumer goods. As to thinking in terms
of the next pay-period, he’s already adjusted
his spending habits for his next promotion!

  а Hacker Dev Kit preorder

Leap Motion and OSVR today announced that the
OSVR Hacker Dev Kit will have an optional
faceplate with Leap Motion’s hardware
and software embedded, making the HDK the
first-to-market virtual reality headset with
natural motion control technology integrated into
the head mounted display. By merging the speed
and accuracy of Leap Motion’s hand tracking
with the growing OSVR ecosystem, users will be
able to create and interact with a wide range
of supported content.

“By letting the user connect directly with the
VR environment, hand tracking allows virtual
reality to be as natural and intuitive as
interacting with the real world, giving the user
a powerful sense of presence and immersion,”
said Michael Buckwald, CEO and Co-founder of Leap
Motion. “We're pleased to partner with OSVR to
bring our technology to the OSVR Hacker Dev Kit,
helping developers enable the true potential
of VR."
