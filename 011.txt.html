Simply applying aerodynamic laws to
the real bumble bee would result in
the conclusion that one should not fly

real world. So sometimes you need pretty
great techical progress to explain even

a given year. Descriptive labels, which
give an idea of the genres the categories
represent, were compiled from descriptions
users of the music discovery tool Last.fm
assigned to songs in each category.

That is quite interesting thing. About
that vision. That all around world is
created by people.  I have some story to
share. May be it's a little bit "pathetic
to talk near Steve icon", but it's real.
I was playing computer games at my fathers
computer center when was kid for some
years before school.  And suddenly I was
thinking following way "look this programs
probably written not by some aliens(but
that time that was not so obvious :-) ).
There is probably somebody who write
this games and they are humans as well,
so intersting who are this people".  And I
aksed my father this question, after some
time my father went to Switzerland on some
project for half a year and returned from
there with 386 machine.  That was first
form of the school. Nothing to say I'm
happy that happened

<h3>

should be programmed to kill?

Sometimes people should do the tough
choice.  Like to cut hand or die.

Now think about this picture below.
How should we program a fully autonomous
car to select what to do in either case?
What is better? Simple answer is to
minimize death. But would you buy such
a car?  That is tricky thing.

So overal this puzzle is about doing it
right in social, behavioural, ethical,
economical and marketing aspects.

For moms and kids as well. And kids
are future us. So basically for
everyone. Simple stats

Even after controlling for gender
attitudes—to take beliefs regarding
gender roles out of the equation—the
researchers found that 33% of daughters
of working mothers held supervisory
roles, compared to only 25% of daughters
of stay-at-home moms. “What I take
away is that employed mothers create an
environment in which their children’s
attitudes on what is appropriate for girls
to do and what is appropriate for boys to
do is affected,” McGinn says.

Of course that could be just a someones
dream, but why not...

Harlan expects a sea change to take
place in the way doctors treat chronic
illness—and the way insurance
charges for it. At the conference,
Kass described a future where doctors
write recipes as prescriptions and
insurance companies treat food as a
reimbursable expense. (There is, of
course, a strong economic argument in
favor of a prevention-based approach to
health.) Harlan predicts that care plans
will eventually include menu planning,
recipes and maybe even programming
to get the ingredients delivered to
patients. “Call me up in ten years and
let’s see if that’s true.”

<h3>
conscious
</h3>
<h4>
mind could work other way
</h4>

IMG:001-consciousness.jpg

Moreover, the widely-accepted global
workspace theory, first suggested by
Bernard Baars in 1982, states that
consciousness occurs when information
is made accessible throughout the brain,
while unconscious information is processed
regionally.

To test these theories, a team of
neurologists and psychiatrists from the
University of Michigan constructed an
experiment using the oddball paradigm,
which involves subjecting participants to
the same regularly-occurring stimulus,
interspersed with one incongruous
stimulus. In this case, subjects were
repeatedly shown the word “LEFT” for
a period of just seven milliseconds at a
time. This is long enough for the brain to
unconsciously register and respond to the
stimulus, but too short for participants
to consciously realize what they had
seen. The oddball came when they were
shown the word “RIGHT,” which was
flashed for the same period of time and
therefore again processed unconsciously.

Using electroencephalography to measure
the neural responses of participants,
the researchers found that the oddball
stimulus generated a P3b response
throughout the brain, despite the whole
process being unconscious. In other words,
the occurrence of P3b revealed that “at
least some forms of widespread, globally
distributed, sustained processing can
occur unconsciously.” The team therefore
concludes that much of what we thought
we knew about consciousness is wrong,
as neither P3b nor global access to
information are NCCs, meaning the great
mystery of our cognizance continues
to deepen.
